/*
 * Phlox Script Engine
 * StateManager.cs — Script runtime state persistence
 *
 * Ported from halcyon-reference/InWorldz/InWorldz.Phlox.Engine/StateManager.cs
 * Adapted for .NET 8: System.Data.SQLite (ADO.NET provider)
 *                     IndexedPriorityQueue → SortedDictionary
 *                     ThreadTracker → plain Thread
 *
 * Saves/restores LSL global variable state, current LSL state name,
 * timer interval, and event queue across region restarts.
 *
 * The serialization format (protobuf-net via SerializedRuntimeState) is
 * already implemented in InWorldz.Phlox.dll — we just call it here.
